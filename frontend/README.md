# Asteria Frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind + Framer Motion)

## Development
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
2. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. The dev server proxies `/api/*` to the backend (configured in `vite.config.js`).

## Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## Notes
- Uses axios for API calls and framer-motion for animations.
- Tailwind for styling. Make sure to run `npm install` to get all packages.
